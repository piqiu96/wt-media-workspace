# Agent Platform Adapter Change

Use this skill when changing platform-specific execution behavior.

## Check

- Platform differences stay under `src/wt_media_agent/platforms`.
- High-risk actions report uncertain results when confirmation fails.
- Runtime adapters do not contain platform business rules.
- Agent does not decide formal Cloud business status.
- External e2e actions require explicit opt-in.

## Output

Summarize platform, action type, risk handling, and test isolation.
